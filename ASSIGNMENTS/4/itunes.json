Check. With the dreamy obstetrician? Check. While her best friend is in labor? Um... It's Complicated. Josie Mendham never meant to have her own (radically different) set of gasps a few doors down from where her best friend, Laura, was giving birth. And stealing away with the obstetrician who was consulting on Laura's case certainly wasn't part of any birth plan. When Dr. Alex Derjian watched the foursome enter the labor ward he did a doubletake: two dads? That defied biology as he knew it. Even more intriguing was the woman with the birthing mother and the fathers: Josie, the nurse he'd been watching from afar for months. One elevator kiss led to an on-call room soiree and soon he was breaking every romantic rule in his playbook. Finding his way into her pants wouldn't be hard. But into her heart? That would be a challenge. It's Complicated IS A STANDALONE NOVEL, but it also includes Laura, Mike, Dylan, Josie, and Madge from the New York Times bestselling Her Billionaires series as well as Darla, Trevor and Joe from the New York Times bestseller Random Acts of Crazy , with Alex and Josie at the center of it all. Romantic Comedy meets new adult romance in this novel that asks whether people can get out of their own way and learn that love isn't easy...but it's always worth it.

A sprawling tale blending science fiction, high technology, and fantasy, The Aliomenti Saga traces the rise and proliferation of a secret group of supernaturally gifted men and women through the life of their most dynamic member, Will Stark. A QUESTION OF WILL (Book 1) Will Stark is a phenomenally successful businessman, happily married, with a young son he adores. When he arrives home on his 35th birthday, he finds the guards to his gated community murdered, his home ablaze with his family inside, and his life nearly ended by those responsible. Will is immersed in the culture of the Alliance, a splinter group of the Aliomenti. He'll learn their secrets... and more about himself and his destiny than he ever imagined possible. PRESERVING HOPE (Book 2) Will meets a young girl named Elizabeth Lowell, resident of a hidden village, daughter of the leader of that village, and one forced against her will to bear the burden of learning the secrets the villagers seek to learn. Elizabeth has secrets of her own, though, and Will must ensure that the revelation of those secrets doesn't result in the girl's death... as it did for her mother. ASCENT OF THE ALIOMENTI (Book 3) Drawing upon his business and life experiences, Will transforms the Aliomenti into a global financial powerhouse awash in technological advances that would astound their human peers. But when power and wealth turn to paranoia, Will must decide if the group can be saved--or if the actions of the Leader of the Aliomenti mean a permanent separation is inevitable."}, "im:vendorName":{"label":"Alex Albrinck"}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0.00000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book", "label":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book"}}, "title":{"label":"The Aliomenti Saga Box Set - Alex Albrinck"}, "im:publisher":{"label":"Alex Albrinck"}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-aliomenti-saga-box-set/id767492563?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-aliomenti-saga-box-set/id767492563?mt=11&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"767492563"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"Alex Albrinck", "attributes":{"href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/alex-albrinck/id590565228?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"11007", "term":"High Tech", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/books-sci-fi-fantasy-science-fiction-literature-high-tech/id11007?mt=11&uo=2", "label":"High Tech"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2013-11-17T00:00:00-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"November 17, 2013"}}},

Annie Fuller, the reluctant clairvoyant, has been called in to investigate by Nate Dawson, her lawyer beau, and the case becomes personal when they discover that Laura, Nate's sister, may be one of the teachers being targeted. In this installment of the Victorian San Francisco Mystery series, readers will find the same blend of a cozy mystery and romantic suspense, played out against the historical backdrop of late 19th century San Francisco, that they found in Maids of Misfortune and Uneasy Spirits. If you are new to this series, you will still enjoy spending time with the lively residents of Annie Fuller's boarding house and visiting San Francisco when Golden Gate Park was filled with horse-drawn carriages, politics were controlled by saloon-keepers, and kisses were stolen under gaslight."}, "im:vendorName":{"label":"Draft2Digital, LLC"}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0.00000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book", "label":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book"}}, "title":{"label":"Bloody Lessons: A Victorian San Francisco Mystery - M.

His solution? “Arm candy,” a beautiful woman to accompany him as his regular date. She’s to serve as a dazzling accessory, not a prostitute or call girl, with no strings attached, either emotional or sexual. Then he sees Nora, and he finds himself overwhelmed with a craving for sweets… Nora Armstrong is a wholesome, virginal beauty fresh from the Midwest. Her cousin asks her to go out with David Waite as a favor to advance his event planning business. She can’t say no, any more than she can say no when David asks for a second date, and a third… According to “arm candy” rules, she should be safe… until David decides to break the rules. Suddenly Nora realizes it’s a risky business, being this smoking hot Brit’s faux girlfriend… and falling in love.

The three Sullivan sisters, named for the Three Graces of Greek legend who embody beauty, charm and grace, don’t live up to their names.&#xa0; Belle is no beauty. Charisma lacks charm. And Grace is somewhat less than graceful.&#xa0; But this doesn’t deter their ambitious mother from bribing three bachelors to escort them to Colorado Springs’ beautiful Garden of the Gods. When the girls overhear their escorts mocking how little they resemble their names, each girl makes a wish at the magical Three Graces rock formation.&#xa0; Belle wishes aloud for beauty, but only so she can use it as a weapon to punish the cads who hurt her sisters.&#xa0; Her true wish is for revenge. Handsome viscount Kit Stanhope regrets his rude remarks and apologizes to Belle. He’s surprised when she tells him that's not enough. If he truly regrets his behavior, he has to make her beautiful in time for the Founders’ Day Ball. Kit isn’t sure he’s up to the task. But, intrigued by the spirited Belle, he agrees to assist her transformation from an ugly duckling into a swan with the help of a mysterious Greek dressmaker with muse-like qualities. Unfortunately, Belle makes a rather awkward swan. Still, after a few embarrassing escapades, she masters the flirtatious language of the fan and takes the town known as Little London by storm.&#xa0; Belle soon finds herself falling for the viscount and his sinful mouth. It seems he returns her regard, but she can’t renege on her promise to humiliate him . . . can she? Will her secret muse grant the wish she voiced . . . or the one she holds in her heart?

Against her will, however, she’s tapped into a killer—or rather, his victims. Each woman’s murder, blow-by-blow, ravages her mind until their death releases her back to her body. Sam knows she must go to the authorities, but will the rugged, no-nonsense detective in charge of tracking down the killer believe her? Detective Brandt Sutherland only trusts hard evidence, yet Sam’s visions offer clues he needs to catch a killer. The more he learns about her incredible abilities, however, the clearer it becomes that Sam’s visions have put her in the killer’s line of fire. Now Brandt must save her from something he cannot see or understand…and risk losing his heart in the process. As danger and desire collide, passion raises the stakes in a game Sam and Brandt don’t dare lose.&#xa0; HIDE'N GO SEEK A twisted game of Hide'n Go Seek forces an alliance between a no-nonsense FBI agent and a search-and-rescue worker. Celebrated search-and-rescue worker Kali Jordon has hidden her psychic abilities by crediting her canine partner Shiloh with the recoveries. But Kali knows the grim truth--The Sight that she inherited from her grandmother allows her to trace violent energy unerringly to victims of murder. No one knows her secret until a twisted killer challenges her to a deadly game of Hide'n Go Seek that threatens those closest to her.&#xa0; Now she must rely on FBI Special Agent Grant Summers, a man who has sworn to protect her, even as he suspects there's more to Kali and Shiloh than meets the eye.

It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.” --Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos A MARCH OF KINGS (Book #2 in the Sorcerer's Ring) takes us one step further on Thor’s epic journey into manhood, as he begins to realize more about who he is, what his powers are, and as he embarks to become a warrior. After he escapes from the dungeon, Thor is horrified to learn of another assassination attempt on King MacGil. When MacGil dies, the kingdom is set into turmoil. As everyone vies for the throne, King’s Court is more rife than ever with its family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence and betrayal. An heir must be chosen from among the children, and the ancient Dynasty Sword, the source of all their power, will have a chance to be wielded by someone new. But all this might be upended: the murder weapon is recovered, and the noose tightens on finding the assassin. Simultaneously, the MacGils face a new threat by the McClouds, who are set to attack again from within the Ring. Thor fights to win back Gwendolyn’s love, but there may not be time: he is told to pack up, to prepare with his brothers in arms for The Hundred, a hundred grueling days of hell that all Legion members must survive. The Legion will have to cross the Canyon, beyond the protection of the Ring, into the Wilds, and set sail across the Tartuvian Sea for the Isle of Mist, said to be patrolled by a dragon, for their initiation into manhood. Will they make it back? Will the Ring survive in their absence? And will Thor finally learn the secret of his destiny? With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A MARCH OF KINGS is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders. It is 60,000 words. Books #3--#17 in the series are also available! “A spirited fantasy that weaves elements of mystery and intrigue into its story line….For those seeking meaty fantasy adventures, the protagonists, devices, and action provide a vigorous set of encounters that focus well on Thor's evolution from a dreamy child to a young adult facing impossible odds for survival….Only the beginning of what promises to be an epic young adult series.” Midwest Book Review (D.

It was a big mistake. His sister has been steadily flushing his money down the drain – and now he wants it back. Years in the special forces taught Lake that if you want a job done, do it yourself. So he steps in to make the shop profitable, sell it and get his money back. The only problem is, the business is an underwear shop. And all Lake knows about underwear can be summed up in how fast he can unsnap a bra. To make matters worse, the tiny highland town already has a lingerie shop. A successful one, run by an ex-lingerie model. A very gorgeous ex-lingerie model, who’s distracting him from his mission more than he’d like to admit. If Lake wants to get his savings back, and get out of Scotland, he only has one option – wipe out the competition. Kirsty Campbell has spent years rebuilding her life after she woke up in hospital in Spain to find her body scarred, and her ex-fiance had run off with all her money. The last thing she needs is a cocky, English soldier-boy trying to ruin all she has left. Her home town is only too happy to help her fight the latest English invasion, although Lake is beginning to sway them with his sex appeal and cut price knickers.

No boundaries. Every page—an open book. Over the years, he’d become something of a folk hero. The crown prince of mayhem who couldn’t be tamed. A source of constant entertainment and levity for the masses. But even by celebrity standards, Nick was a rare breed.

To protect. To shine a spotlight on all the good things—half to highlight them, half to keep that same spotlight off everything bad. By protecting his image, I was protecting their shareholders, and thus—doing my not inconsiderable part to contribute to the massive global conglomeration that was his father’s company.

Sixteen-year-old Autumn goes to stay with her friend Carley in Castleton, Maine, for the summer. All she’s expecting is a normal couple of months hanging out at the beach with friends. Nothing out of the ordinary is supposed to happen. But as soon as she arrives she meets Holt Roth. Holt is unlike anyone she’s ever met before – and her reaction to him is even more unexpected. Then she meets Holt’s friend, Samuel Cheshire. If her reaction to Holt was strong, her reaction to Samuel is shocking. The only problem is that he seems to hate her for no reason at all. Autumn knows there's something very strange going on, but no one will tell her anything.

Each year, three villagers enter the mist searching for answers. No one ever returns.&#xa0; Then a dragon falls from the sky to the town square, dead—the first glimpse of an outside world that has become nothing more than a fairy tale to Hutton’s Bridge. Except to Tressa.&#xa0; Tressa grew up with Granna’s stories of the days before the fog fell. When Granna dies, leaving Tressa without any family, Tressa ventures into the fog herself, vowing to unravel the foul magic holding Hutton’s Bridge captive.&#xa0; What she discovers beyond the fog endangers the lives of everyone she loves.&#xa0; Hunted:&#xa0; The fog that trapped the people of Hutton's Bridge for eighty years has disappeared, but now so have the villagers.&#xa0; Fearing the worst, Tressa and Bastian must navigate a new and dangerous world in search of their people.

A terrible calamity in the past had blanketed much of the world with a toxic \"fug.\" Those who survived were forced to take to the mountains and the skies in wondrous airships. Life has since been a struggle, with only the most ruthless and crafty able to survive. To spare themselves the same fate, the Calderans erected a battery of guns to fend off the airships of the mainland. They isolated themselves from the madness of the world, choosing instead to focus on the pursuits of art and creativity. Few believe the technologically advanced but socially barbarous outsiders have anything to offer. Amanita Graus, though, is hoping that they do. Nita's mother has lost her livelihood and perhaps soon her life to a terrible disease. Already the black sheep of the family for embracing engineering rather than art, Nita resolves to leave the safety of her home and do whatever it takes to find a cure. For a price, the bizarre crew of an airship called The Wind Breaker are willing to grant her a meeting with their mysterious benefactors, and thus a chance to procure the one thing with a chance to save her mother. Free-Wrench follows Nita’s adventures in a steampunk world of airships and lunatics. Helping her in her journey are an eccentric crew of smugglers; the gruff Cap’n Mack, the simple but enthusiastic Lil and Coop, the arrogant marksman Gunner, the surly surgeon Butch, and the irritable mascot Wink. To survive and find what she seeks she’ll need to earn their trust, follow their rules, and meet face to face with the people who pull the strings of their society."}, "im:vendorName":{"label":"Smashwords"}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0.00000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book", "label":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book"}}, "title":{"label":"Free-Wrench - Joseph R.

So hot you won’t be able to put it down! As a corporate lawyer, there isn’t a whole that gets by Hannah, much less the warning signs of a failing relationship. She knows that her four-month-old relationship with Josh Homes is already over, but he breaks down in tears when she tries to break up with him. She’s too sympathetic and can’t stand to see him cry, so she gives him what he wants: a weeklong trip to Friday Harbor to attend his sister’s wedding, during which he hopes to show Hannah that they were meant for each other.&#xa0; Matthew Homes hasn’t seen his brother Josh in nearly a decade. Their relationship has been stormy since long before Matthew used his share of the family fortune to set up the biggest real-estate conglomerate in the United States, while Josh blew his share on small businesses that failed, leaving him an everyday accountant. But Matthew isn’t just a successful real-estate mogul—he’s also the ultimate dominant, with sinfully tempting looks and the sly prowess and charm of a panther.&#xa0; When Matthew sees Josh at the wedding, he’s immediately taken aback by the sexy and confident woman he calls his girlfriend.&#xa0; But will Matthew fall for Josh and Hannah’s act? Will Matthew be able to resist the temptation of Hannah and steer clear of deepening the feud with his brother?&#xa0; And what will happen when Matthew finds Hannah wandering aimlessly in the middle of the night and becomes overwhelmed with a desire to see her kneeling at his feet?"}, "im:vendorName":{"label":"Vasko Pty Ltd"}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0.00000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book", "label":"MZRssItemTypeIdentifier.Book"}}, "title":{"label":"Hotter Than Ever - Lucia Jordan"}, "im:publisher":{"label":"Vasko Books"}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hotter-than-ever/id1206131086?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hotter-than-ever/id1206131086?mt=11&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"1206131086"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"Lucia Jordan", "attributes":{"href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/lucia-jordan/id604287213?mt=11&uo=2"}}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"10056", "term":"Erotic Romance", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/books-romance-erotic-romance/id10056?mt=11&uo=2", "label":"Erotic Romance"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2017-02-15T00:00:00-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"February 15, 2017"}}},
